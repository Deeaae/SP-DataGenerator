# SP-DataGenerator
## [Space Port] [Dock] [Data Generator] [1.0]
This is part of Space Port series.
This series exist to explore new frontiers and experiments with new stuff.
Dock is the sub series within it. Here I do not experiemnt with new stuff but collect my existing learnings into one place
Data Generartor is the first module.

**[Version 1.0]**

This will be a standalone Spring boot application that will be generating random scores. I would at this point not prefer to
shape what these scores are about and would rather address that at later stage.
After generating data it will be pushed to a dummy queue that will again be replaced later
